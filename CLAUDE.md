Never use claude -p command. 

This project is a reverse engineering of the claude code communication protocol. 

it is based on the internal teams/inbox/tasks filesystem protocol. 

The goal is to be able to spawn agents, send messages to them, and get the responses.
You should be able to spawn agents, see their responses, send them more messages, give them permissions, etc.....

This is based on an initial investigation that you can find here https://www.notion.so/Claude-Code-Architecture-Interne-SDK-Agent-2ff324e51ac28139b0cceb77975fa01c
